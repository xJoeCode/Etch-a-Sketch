This is my version of the Etch-a-Sketch project from the Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

It has inputs to generate the size and colors of the sketchpad as well as the pen/tiles as many times as they want. By holding down and dragging across the sketchpad, users can do a sketch. It works by changing the background color of the tiles. There are buttons to reset the sketchpad as well as options to mouse over instead of dragging.

To build the sketchpad itself, I created a div with the createElement function and clone them with the cloneNode using loops. To calculate how much to clone to build the sketchpad. i calculated using square root(size of the sketchpad / size of each tile).

Difficulties i faced:

The issue of the cloneNode not generating enough tiles to form a perfect square for the sketchpad. to fix that I used math.round(size of sketchpad/size of each tile)* size of each tile, so that there is no remainder when I use the above square root.

QuerySelector not selecting all of the tiles generated by the cloneNode.
